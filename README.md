# Causal-effects-of-special-events-on-shared-micromobility
Precise prompts + small-events &amp; protest datasets for venue-scale DML analysis of special events and shared micromobility (Washington, DC).


## Overview

This repository supports our manuscript on the causal effects of special events on shared micromobility in Washington, DC.

It provides the exact LLM prompts used for event subcategory labeling and releases two event datasets used in the paper’s heterogeneity analysis: Small events and Protests.

Other datasets (e.g., full trip logs, large events) are not redistributed due to licensing restrictions.
